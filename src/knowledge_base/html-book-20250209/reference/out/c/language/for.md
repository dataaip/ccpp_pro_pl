Executes a loop.

Used as a shorter equivalent of while loop.

### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| attr-spec-seq(since C23)(optional) `for` `(` init-clause `;` cond-expression `;` iteration-expression `)` loop-statement |  |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

### Explanation

Behaves as follows:

- init-clause may be an expression or a declaration(since C99).

:   - An init-clause, which is an expression, is evaluated once, before the first evaluation of cond-expression and its result is discarded.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| - An init-clause, which is a declaration, is in scope in the entire loop body, including the remainder of init-clause, the entire cond-expression, the entire iteration-expression and the entire loop-statement. Only `auto` and `register` storage class specifiers are allowed for the variables declared in this declaration. | (since C99) |

- cond-expression is evaluated before the loop body. If the result of the expression is zero, the loop statement is exited immediately.
- iteration-expression is evaluated after the loop body and its result is discarded. After evaluating iteration-expression, control is transferred to cond-expression.

init-clause, cond-expression, and iteration-expression are all optional. If cond-expression is omitted, it is replaced with a non-zero integer constant, which makes the loop endless:

```
for(;;) {
   printf("endless loop!");
}

```

loop-statement is not optional, but it may be a null statement:

```
for(int n = 0; n < 10; ++n, printf("%d\n", n))
    ; // null statement

```

If the execution of the loop needs to be terminated at some point, a  break statement can be used anywhere within the loop-statement.

The  continue statement used anywhere within the loop-statement transfers control to iteration-expression.

A program with an endless loop has undefined behavior if the loop has no observable behavior (I/O, volatile accesses, atomic or synchronization operation) in any part of its cond-expression, iteration-expression or loop-statement. This allows the compilers to optimize out all unobservable loops without proving that they terminate. The only exceptions are the loops where
cond-expression is omitted or is a constant expression; `for(;;)` is always an endless loop.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| As with all other selection and iteration statements, the for statement establishes block scope: any identifier introduced in the init-clause, cond-expression, or iteration-expression goes out of scope after the loop-statement. | (since C99) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| attr-spec-seq is an optional list of attributes, applied to the `for` statement. | (since C23) |

### Keywords

for

### Notes

The expression statement used as loop-statement establishes its own block scope, distinct from the scope of init-clause, unlike in C++:

```
for (int i = 0; ; ) {
    long i = 1;   // valid C, invalid C++
    // ...
}

```

It is possible to enter the body of a loop using goto. When entering a loop in this manner, init-clause and cond-expression are not executed. (If control then reaches the end of the loop body, repetition may occur including execution of cond-expression.)

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
enum { SIZE = 8 };
int main(void)
{
    int array[SIZE];
    for(size_t i = 0 ; i < SIZE; ++i)
        array [i] = rand() % 2;
    printf("Array filled!\n");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i)
        printf("%d ", array[i]);
    putchar('\n');
}

```

Possible output:

```
Array filled!
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

```
