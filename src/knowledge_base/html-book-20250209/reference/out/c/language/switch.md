Executes code according to the value of an integral argument.

Used where one or several out of many branches of code need to be executed according to an integral value.

### Syntax

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| attr-spec-seq(optional) `switch (` expression `)` statement |  |  |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| attr-spec-seq | - | (C23)optional list of attributes, applied to the `switch` statement |
| expression | - | any expression of integer type (char, signed or unsigned integer, or enumeration) |
| statement | - | any statement (typically a compound statement). `case:` and `default:` labels are permitted in statement, and break; statement has special meaning. |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `case` constant-expression `:` statement | (1) | (until C23) |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| attr-spec-seq(optional) `case` constant-expression `:` statement(optional) | (1) | (since C23) |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| `default` `:` statement | (2) | (until C23) |
|  | | | | | | | | | |
| attr-spec-seq(optional) `default` `:` statement(optional) | (2) | (since C23) |
|  | | | | | | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constant-expression | - | any integer constant expression |
| attr-spec-seq | - | (C23)optional list of attributes, applied to the label |

### Explanation

The body of a switch statement may have an arbitrary number of `case:` labels, as long as the values of all constant-expressions are unique (after conversion to the promoted type of expression). At most one `default:` label may be present (although nested switch statements may use their own `default:` labels or have `case:` labels whose constants are identical to the ones used in the enclosing switch).

If expression evaluates to the value that is equal to the value of one of constant-expressions after conversion to the promoted type of expression, then control is transferred to the statement that is labeled with that constant-expression.

If expression evaluates to a value that doesn't match any of the `case:` labels, and the `default:` label is present, control is transferred to the statement labeled with the `default:` label.

If expression evaluates to a value that doesn't match any of the `case:` labels, and the `default:` label is not present, none of the switch body is executed.

The break statement, when encountered anywhere in statement, exits the switch statement:

```
switch(1) {
    case 1 : puts("1"); // prints "1",
    case 2 : puts("2"); // then prints "2" ("fall-through")
}

```

```
switch(1) {
    case 1 : puts("1"); // prints "1"
             break;     // and exits the switch
    case 2 : puts("2");
             break;
}

```

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| As with all other selection and iteration statements, the switch statement establishes block scope: any identifier introduced in the expression goes out of scope after the statement.  If a VLA or another identifier with variably-modified type has a `case:` or a `default:` label within its scope, the entire switch statement must be in its scope (in other words, a VLA must be declared either before the entire switch or after the last label):   ```text switch (expr) {         int i = 4; // not a VLA; OK to declare here         f(i); // never called //      int a[i]; // error: VLA cannot be declared here     case 0:         i = 17;     default:         int a[i]; // OK to declare VLA here         printf("%d\n", i); // prints 17 if expr == 0, prints indeterminate value otherwise } ``` | (since C99) |

### Keywords

switch,
case,
default

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
 
void func(int x)
{
   printf("func(%d): ", x);
   switch(x)
   {
      case 1: printf("case 1, ");
      case 2: printf("case 2, ");
      case 3: printf("case 3.\n"); break;
      case 4: printf("case 4, ");
      case 5:
      case 6: printf("case 5 or case 6, ");
      default: printf("default.\n");
   }
}
 
int main(void)
{
   for(int i = 1; i < 9; ++i) func(i);
}

```

Output:

```
func(1): case 1, case 2, case 3.
func(2): case 2, case 3.
func(3): case 3.
func(4): case 4, case 5 or case 6, default.
func(5): case 5 or case 6, default.
func(6): case 5 or case 6, default.
func(7): default.
func(8): default.

```
