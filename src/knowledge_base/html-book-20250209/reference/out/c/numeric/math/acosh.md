1-3) Computes the inverse hyperbolic cosine of arg.4) Type-generic macro: If the argument has type long double, `acoshl` is called. Otherwise, if the argument has integer type or the type double, `acosh` is called. Otherwise, `acoshf` is called. If the argument is complex, then the macro invokes the corresponding complex function (cacoshf, cacosh, cacoshl).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value representing the area of a hyperbolic sector |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the inverse hyperbolic cosine of arg (cosh-1  
(arg), or arcosh(arg)) on the interval [0, +∞], is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

If the argument is less than 1, a domain error occurs.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is less than 1, FE_INVALID is raised an NaN is returned.
- If the argument is 1, +0 is returned.
- If the argument is +∞, +∞ is returned.
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

Although the C standard names this function "arc hyperbolic cosine", the inverse functions of the hyperbolic functions are the area functions. Their argument is the area of a hyperbolic sector, not an arc. The correct name is "inverse hyperbolic cosine" (used by POSIX) or "area hyperbolic cosine".

    // error handling
    errno = 0; feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    printf("acosh(0.5) = %f\n", acosh(0.5));

```

Possible output:

```
acosh(1) = 0.000000
acosh(10) = 2.993223
acosh(DBL_MAX) = 710.475860
acosh(Inf) = inf
acosh(0.5) = -nan
    errno == EDOM: Numerical argument out of domain
    FE_INVALID raised
