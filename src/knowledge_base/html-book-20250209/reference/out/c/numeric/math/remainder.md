1-3) Computes the IEEE remainder of the floating-point division operation x/y.4) Type-generic macro: If any argument has type long double, `remainderl` is called. Otherwise, if any argument has integer type or has type double, `remainder` is called. Otherwise, `remainderf` is called.

The IEEE floating-point remainder of the division operation x/y calculated by this function is exactly the value x - n \* y, where the value `n` is the integral value nearest the exact value x/y. When |n-x/y| = ½, the value `n` is chosen to be even.

In contrast to fmod(), the returned value is not guaranteed to have the same sign as x.

If the returned value is ​0​, it will have the same sign as x.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x, y | - | floating-point values |

### Return value

If successful, returns the IEEE floating-point remainder of the division x/y as defined above.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result is returned.

If y is zero, but the domain error does not occur, zero is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

Domain error may occur if y is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- The current rounding mode has no effect.
- FE_INEXACT is never raised, the result is always exact.
- If x is ±∞ and y is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.
- If y is ±0 and x is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.
- If either argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

POSIX requires that a domain error occurs if x is infinite or y is zero.

fmod, but not `remainder` is useful for doing silent wrapping of floating-point types to unsigned integer types: (0.0 <= (y = fmod(rint(x), 65536.0)) ? y : 65536.0 + y) is in the range `[`-0.0`,`65535.0`]`, which corresponds to unsigned short, but remainder(rint(x), 65536.0) is in the range `[`-32767.0`,`+32768.0`]`, which is outside of the range of signed short.

#include <fenv.h>

Output:

```

remainder(-5.1, +3.0) = 0.9
remainder(+5.1, -3.0) = -0.9
remainder(-5.1, -3.0) = 0.9
remainder(+0.0, 1.0) = 0.0
remainder(-0.0, 1.0) = -0.0
remainder(+5.1, Inf) = 5.1
remainder(+5.1, 0) = -nan
    FE_INVALID raised
