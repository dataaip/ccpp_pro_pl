| Defined in header `<string.h>` |  |  |
| char \*strdup( const char \*src ); |  | (since C23) |
|  |  |  |

Returns a pointer to a null-terminated byte string, which is a duplicate of the string pointed to by `src`. The space for the new string is obtained as if the malloc was invoked. The returned pointer must be passed to free to avoid a memory leak.

If an error occurs, a null pointer is returned and errno might be set.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| src | - | pointer to the null-terminated byte string to duplicate |

### Return value

A pointer to the newly allocated string, or a null pointer if an error occurred.

### Notes

The function is identical to the POSIX strdup.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    const char *s1 = "Duplicate me!";
    char *s2 = strdup(s1);
    printf("s2 = \"%s\"\n", s2);
    free(s2);
}

```

Output:

```
s2 = "Duplicate me!"

```
