| Defined in header `<wctype.h>` |  |  |
| int iswdigit( wint_t ch ); |  | (since C95) |
|  |  |  |

Checks if the given wide character corresponds (if narrowed) to one of the ten decimal digit characters 0123456789.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch | - | wide character |

### Return value

Non-zero value if the wide character is a numeric character, zero otherwise.

### Notes

`iswdigit` and iswxdigit are the only standard wide character classification functions that are not affected by the currently installed C locale.

### Example

Some locales offer additional character classes that detect non-ASCII digits

Run this code

```
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <wctype.h>
 
void test(wchar_t a3, wchar_t u3, wchar_t j3)
{
    printf("\t '%lc'  '%lc' '%lc'\n", a3, u3, j3);
    printf("iswdigit: %d    %d    %d\n",
           !!iswdigit(a3),
           !!iswdigit(u3),
           !!iswdigit(j3));
    printf("jdigit:   %d    %d    %d\n",
           !!iswctype(a3, wctype("jdigit")),
           !!iswctype(u3, wctype("jdigit")),
           !!iswctype(j3, wctype("jdigit")));
}
 
int main(void)
{
    wchar_t a3 = L'3';  // the ASCII digit 3
    wchar_t u3 = L'三'; // the CJK numeral 3
    wchar_t j3 = L'３'; // the full-width digit 3
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    puts("In American locale:");
    test(a3, u3, j3);
 
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.utf8");
    puts("\nIn Japanese locale:");
    test(a3, u3, j3);
}

```

Possible output:

```
In American locale:
         '3'  '三' '３'
iswdigit: 1    0    0
jdigit:   0    0    0
 
In Japanese locale:
         '3'  '三' '３'
iswdigit: 1    0    0
jdigit:   0    0    1

```
