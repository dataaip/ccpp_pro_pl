| Defined in header `<threads.h>` |  |  |
| int mtx_trylock( mtx_t \*mutex ); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Tries to lock the mutex pointed to by `mutex` without blocking. Returns immediately if the mutex is already locked.

Prior calls to mtx_unlock on the same mutex **synchronize-with** this operation (if this operation succeeds), and all lock/unlock operations on any given mutex form a single total order (similar to the modification order of an atomic)

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mutex | - | pointer to the mutex to lock |

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_busy if the mutex has already been locked or due to a spurious failure to acquire an available mutex, thrd_error if an error occurs.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DR 470 | C11 | `mtx_trylock` was not allowed to fail spuriously | allowed |
