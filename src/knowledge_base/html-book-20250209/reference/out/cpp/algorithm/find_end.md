|  |  |  |

Searches for the last occurrence of the sequence ``s_first`,`s_last`)` in the range `[`first`,`last`)`.

1) Elements are compared using operator==.3) Elements are compared using the given binary predicate p.2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy. These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (until C++20) |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| s_first, s_last | - | the range of elements to search for |
| policy | - | the execution policy to use |
| p | - | binary predicate which returns ​true if the elements should be treated as equal.   The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the following:   bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);  While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) `Type1` and `Type2` regardless of value category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for `Type1` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).  The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that objects of types ForwardIt1 and ForwardIt2 can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type1 and Type2 respectively. ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`ForwardIt1` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |
| -`ForwardIt2` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |

### Return value

Iterator to the beginning of last occurrence of the sequence ``s_first`,`s_last`)` in range `[`first`,`last`)`.

If `[`s_first`,`s_last`)` is empty or if no such sequence is found, last is returned.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as [std::distance(first, last) and \(\scriptsize S\)S as std::distance(s_first, s_last):

1,2) At most \(\scriptsize S\cdot(N-S+1)\)S·(N-S+1) comparisons using operator==.3,4) At most \(\scriptsize S\cdot(N-S+1)\)S·(N-S+1) applications of the predicate p.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and `ExecutionPolicy` is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other `ExecutionPolicy`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

| find_end (3) |
| ```text template<class ForwardIt1, class ForwardIt2, class BinaryPred> constexpr //< since C++20 ForwardIt1 find_end(ForwardIt1 first, ForwardIt1 last,                     ForwardIt2 s_first, ForwardIt2 s_last,                     BinaryPred p) {     if (s_first == s_last)         return last;       ForwardIt1 result = last;     while (true)     {         ForwardIt1 new_result = std::search(first, last, s_first, s_last, p);         if (new_result == last)             break;         else         {             result = new_result;             first = result;             ++first;         }     }     return result; } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
auto print_result = [](auto result, const auto& v)
{
    result == v.end()
        ? std::cout << "Sequence not found\n"
        : std::cout << "Last occurrence is at: " << std::distance(v.begin(), result)
                    << '\n';
};
 
int main()
{
    const auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    for (auto const& x : {std::array{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}})
    {
        auto iter = std::find_end(v.begin(), v.end(), x.begin(), x.end()); // overload (1)
        print_result(iter, v);
    }
 
    for (auto const& x : {std::array{-1, -2, -3}, {-4, -5, -6}})
    {
        auto iter = std::find_end(v.begin(), v.end(), x.begin(), x.end(), // overload (3)
                                  [](int x, int y)
                                  {
                                      return std::abs(x) == std::abs(y);
                                  });
        print_result(iter, v);
    }
}

```

Output:

```
Last occurrence is at: 8
Sequence not found
Last occurrence is at: 8
Sequence not found

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 1205 | C++98 | the return value was unclear if ``s_first`,`s_last`)` is empty | returns last in this case |
| [LWG 2150 | C++98 | the condition of “sequence occurence” was incorrect | corrected |
