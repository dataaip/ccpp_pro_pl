| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<algorithm>` |  |  |
| template< class InputIt, class UnaryFunc >  UnaryFunc for_each( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryFunc f ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class UnaryFunc >  void for_each( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,                ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, UnaryFunc f ); | (2) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Applies the given function object f to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range ``first`,`last`)`. If f returns a result, the result is ignored.

1) f is applied in order starting from first.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If `UnaryFunc` is not [MoveConstructible, the behavior is undefined. | (since C++11) |

2) f might not be applied in order. The algorithm is executed according to policy. This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (until C++20) |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (since C++20) |

 If `UnaryFunc` is not CopyConstructible, the behavior is undefined.

If the iterator type (`InputIt`/`ForwardIt`) is mutable, f may modify the elements of the range through the dereferenced iterator.

Unlike the rest of the parallel algorithms, `for_each` is not allowed to make copies of the elements in the sequence even if they are TriviallyCopyable.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range to apply the function to |
| policy | - | the execution policy to use |
| f | - | function object, to be applied to the result of dereferencing every iterator in the range ``first`,`last`)`  The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following:   void fun(const Type &a);  The signature does not need to have const &.  The type  Type must be such that an object of type InputIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to  Type.  ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`InputIt` must meet the requirements of [LegacyInputIterator. | | |
| -`ForwardIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |

### Return value

1) f2) (none)

### Complexity

Exactly std::distance(first, last) applications of f.

### Exceptions

The overload with a template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` reports errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and `ExecutionPolicy` is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other `ExecutionPolicy`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

See also the implementations in libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC stdlib.

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class UnaryFunc> constexpr UnaryFunc for_each(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryFunc f) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         f(*first);       return f; // implicit move since C++11 } ``` |

### Notes

For overload (1), f can be a stateful function object. The return value can be considered as the final state of the batch operation.

For overload (2), multiple copies of f may be created to perform parallel invocation. No value is returned because parallelization often does not permit efficient state accumulation.

### Example

The following example uses a lambda-expression to increment all of the elements of a vector and then uses an overloaded `operator()` in a function object (a.k.a., "functor") to compute their sum. Note that to compute the sum, it is recommended to use the dedicated algorithm std::accumulate.

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{3, -4, 2, -8, 15, 267};
 
    auto print = [](const int& n) { std::cout << n << ' '; };
 
    std::cout << "before:\t";
    std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    // increment elements in-place
    std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int &n) { n++; });
 
    std::cout << "after:\t";
    std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), print);
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    struct Sum
    {
        void operator()(int n) { sum += n; }
        int sum {0};
    };
 
    // invoke Sum::operator() for each element
    Sum s = std::for_each(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), Sum());    
    std::cout << "sum:\t" << s.sum << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
before:	3 -4 2 -8 15 267 
after:	4 -3 3 -7 16 268 
sum:	281

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 475 | C++98 | it was unclear whether f can modify the elements of the sequence being iterated over (`for_each` is classified as “non-modifying sequence operations”) | made clear (allowed if the iterator type is mutable) |
| LWG 2747 | C++11 | overload (1) returned std::move(f) | returns f (which implicitly moves) |
