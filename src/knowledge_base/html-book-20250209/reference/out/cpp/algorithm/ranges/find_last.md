Returns the last element in the range ``first`,`last`)` that satisfies specific criteria:

1) `find_last` searches for an element equal to value.3) `find_last_if` searches for the last element in the range `[`first`,`last`)` for which predicate pred returns true.5) `find_last_if_not` searches for the last element in the range `[`first`,`last`)` for which predicate pred returns false.2,4,6) Same as (1,3,5), but uses r as the source range, as if using [ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| r | - | the range of the elements to examine |
| value | - | value to compare the elements to |
| pred | - | predicate to apply to the projected elements |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

1,3,5) Let i be the last iterator in the range ``first`,`last`)` for which E is true. Returns [ranges::subrange<I>{i, last}, or ranges::subrange<I>{last, last} if no such iterator is found.1) E is bool(std::invoke(proj, \*i) == value).3) E is bool(std::invoke(pred, std::invoke(proj, \*i))).5) E is bool(!std::invoke(pred, std::invoke(proj, \*i))).2,4,6) Same as (1,3,5) but the return type is ranges::borrowed_subrange_t<I>.

### Complexity

At most last - first applications of the predicate and projection.

### Notes

`ranges::find_last`, `ranges::find_last_if`, `ranges::find_last_if_not` have better efficiency on common implementations if `I` models `bidirectional_iterator` or (better) `random_access_iterator`.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_ranges_find_last` | `202207L` | (C++23) | `ranges::find_last`, `ranges::find_last_if`, `ranges::find_last_if_not` |
| `__cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type` | `202403L` | (C++26) | List-initialization for algorithms (1,2) |

### Possible implementation

These implementations only show the slower algorithm used when I models `forward_iterator`.
