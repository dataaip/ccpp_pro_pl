Removes all elements satisfying specific criteria from the range ``first`,`last`)` and returns a subrange `[`ret`,`last`)`, where ret is a past-the-end iterator for the new end of the range.

1) Removes all elements that are equal to value, using [std::invoke(proj, \*i) == value to compare.3) Removes all elements for which std::invoke(pred, std::invoke(proj, \*i)) returns true.2,4) Same as (1,3), but uses r as the range, as if using ranges::begin(r) as first and ranges::end(r) as last.

Removing is done by shifting (by means of move assignment) the elements in the range in such a way that the elements that are not to be removed appear in the beginning of the range. Relative order of the elements that remain is preserved and the **physical** size of the container is unchanged. Iterators pointing to an element between the new **logical** end and the **physical** end of the range are still dereferenceable, but the elements themselves have unspecified values (as per MoveAssignable post-condition).

The function-like entities described on this page are **algorithm function objects** (informally known as **niebloids**), that is:

- Explicit template argument lists cannot be specified when calling any of them.
- None of them are visible to argument-dependent lookup.
- When any of them are found by normal unqualified lookup as the name to the left of the function-call operator, argument-dependent lookup is inhibited.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to process |
| r | - | the range of elements to process |
| value | - | the value of elements to remove |
| pred | - | predicate to apply to the projected elements |
| proj | - | projection to apply to the elements |

### Return value

{ret, last}, where ``first`,`ret`)` is the resulting subrange after removal, and the elements in subrange `[`ret`,`last`)` are all in valid but unspecified state, i.e. `[`ret`,`last`)` is the subrange to be erased.

### Complexity

Exactly N applications of the corresponding predicate and any projection, where N = [ranges::distance(first, last), and N - 1 move operations at worst.

### Notes

A call to `ranges::remove` is typically followed by a call to a container's `erase` member function, which erases the unspecified values and reduces the **physical** size of the container to match its new **logical** size. These two invocations together constitute a so-called Erase-remove idiom, which can be achieved by the free function std::erase that has overloads for all standard **sequence** containers, or std::erase_if that has overloads for **all** standard containers.

The similarly-named container member functions list::remove, list::remove_if, forward_list::remove, and forward_list::remove_if erase the removed elements.

These algorithms usually cannot be used with associative containers such as std::set and std::map because their iterator types do not dereference to MoveAssignable types (the keys in these containers are not modifiable).

Because `ranges::remove` takes value by reference, it can have unexpected behavior if it is a reference to an element of the range ``first`,`last`)`.

    // creating a view into a container that is modified by `remove_if`:
    for (std::string s : {"Small Object Optimization", "Non-Type Template Parameter"})
        std::cout << std::quoted(s) << " => "
            << std::string_view{begin(s), std::ranges::remove_if(s, rm).begin()} << '\n';
 
    std::vector<std::complex<double>> nums{{2, 2}, {1, 3}, {4, 8}};
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        auto e = std::ranges::remove(nums, {1, 3}); // T gets deduced
    #else
        auto e = std::ranges::remove(nums, std::complex<double>{1, 3});
    #endif
    nums.erase(e.begin(), e.end());
    assert((nums == std::vector<std::complex<double>>{{2, 2}, {4, 8}}));
}

```

Possible output:

```
"No _ Diagnostic _ Required" (v1, size: 26)
"No_Diagnostic_Requiredired" (v1 after `remove`, size: 26)
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"No_Diagnostic_Required" (v1 after `erase`, size: 22)
 
"Substitution Failure Is Not An Error" (v2, size: 36)
"SFINAEtution Failure Is Not An Error" (v2 after `remove_if`, size: 36)
 ^^^^^^
"SFINAE" (v2 after `erase`, size: 6)
 
"Small Object Optimization" => SOO
"Non-Type Template Parameter" => NTTP
