|  |  |  |

Constructs a sorted union beginning at d_first consisting of the set of elements present in one or both sorted ranges ``first1`,`last1`)` and `[`first2`,`last2`)`.

If `[`first1`,`last1`)` contains m elements that are equivalent to each other and `[`first2`,`last2`)` contains n elements that are equivalent to them, then all m elements will be copied from `[`first1`,`last1`)` to the output range, preserving order, and then the final [std::max(n - m, 0) elements will be copied from ``first2`,`last2`)` to the output range, also preserving order.

1) If `[`first1`,`last1`)` or `[`first2`,`last2`)` is not [sorted with respect to operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20), the behavior is undefined.3) If ``first1`,`last1`)` or `[`first2`,`last2`)` is not sorted with respect to comp, the behavior is undefined.2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy. These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (until C++20) |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (since C++20) |

If the output range overlaps with ``first1`,`last1`)` or `[`first2`,`last2`)`, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first1, last1 | - | the first input sorted range |
| first2, last2 | - | the second input sorted range |
| d_first | - | the beginning of the output range |
| policy | - | the [execution policy to use |
| comp | - | comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare) which returns ​true if the first argument is **less** than (i.e. is ordered **before**) the second.   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following:  bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);  While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) `Type1` and `Type2` regardless of value category (thus, `Type1&` is not allowed, nor is `Type1` unless for `Type1` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).  The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that objects of types InputIt1 and InputIt2 can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both Type1 and Type2. ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`InputIt1, InputIt2` must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator. | | |
| -`ForwardIt1, ForwardIt2, ForwardIt3` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |
| -`OutputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator. | | |
| -`Compare` must meet the requirements of Compare. | | |

### Return value

Iterator past the end of the constructed range.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N_1\)N1 as std::distance(first1, last1) and \(\scriptsize N_2\)N2 as std::distance(first2, last2):

1,2) At most \(\scriptsize 2 \cdot (N_1+N_2)-1\)2⋅(N1+N2)-1 comparisons using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).3,4) At most \(\scriptsize 2 \cdot (N_1+N_2)-1\)2⋅(N1+N2)-1 applications of the comparison function comp.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and `ExecutionPolicy` is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other `ExecutionPolicy`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

| set_union (1) |
| --- |
| ```text template<class InputIt1, class InputIt2, class OutputIt> OutputIt set_union(InputIt1 first1, InputIt1 last1,                    InputIt2 first2, InputIt2 last2, OutputIt d_first) {     for (; first1 != last1; ++d_first)     {         if (first2 == last2)             return std::copy(first1, last1, d_first);           if (*first2 < *first1)             *d_first = *first2++;         else         {             *d_first = *first1;             if (!(*first1 < *first2))                 ++first2;             ++first1;         }     }     return std::copy(first2, last2, d_first); } ``` |
| set_union (3) |
| ```text template<class InputIt1, class InputIt2, class OutputIt, class Compare> OutputIt set_union(InputIt1 first1, InputIt1 last1,                    InputIt2 first2, InputIt2 last2, OutputIt d_first, Compare comp) {     for (; first1 != last1; ++d_first)     {         if (first2 == last2)             // Finished range 2, include the rest of range 1:             return std::copy(first1, last1, d_first);           if (comp(*first2, *first1))             *d_first = *first2++;         else         {             *d_first = *first1;             if (!comp(*first1, *first2)) // Equivalent => don't need to include *first2.                 ++first2;             ++first1;         }     }     // Finished range 1, include the rest of range 2:     return std::copy(first2, last2, d_first); } ``` |

### Notes

This algorithm performs a similar task as std::merge does. Both consume two sorted input ranges and produce a sorted output with elements from both inputs. The difference between these two algorithms is with handling values from both input ranges which compare equivalent (see notes on LessThanComparable). If any equivalent values appeared n times in the first range and m times in the second, std::merge would output all n + m occurrences whereas `std::set_union` would output std::max(n, m) ones only. So `std::merge` outputs exactly std::distance(first1, last1) + std::distance(first2, last2) values and `std::set_union` may produce fewer.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
void println(const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    for (int i : v)
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v1, v2, dest;
 
    v1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    v2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
 
    std::set_union(v1.cbegin(), v1.cend(),
                   v2.cbegin(), v2.cend(),
                   std::back_inserter(dest));
    println(dest);
 
    dest.clear();
 
    v1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5};
    v2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
 
    std::set_union(v1.cbegin(), v1.cend(),
                   v2.cbegin(), v2.cend(),
                   std::back_inserter(dest));
    println(dest);
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
1 2 3 4 5 5 5 6 7

```
