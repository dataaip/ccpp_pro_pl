Returns a range containing all elements with the given key in the container. The range is defined by two iterators, one pointing to the first element that is **not less** than key and another pointing to the first element **greater** than key. Alternatively, the first iterator may be obtained with lower_bound(), and the second with upper_bound().

1,2) Compares the keys to key.3,4) Compares the keys to the value x. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | - | key value to compare the elements to |
| x | - | alternative value that can be compared to `Key` |

### Return value

std::pair containing a pair of iterators defining the wanted range: the first pointing to the first element that is not **less** than key and the second pointing to the first element **greater** than key.

If there are no elements **not less** than key, past-the-end (see end()) iterator is returned as the first element. Similarly if there are no elements **greater** than key, past-the-end iterator is returned as the second element.

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <flat_map>
 
int main()
{
    const std::flat_map<int, const char*> m
    {
        {0, "zero"},
        {1, "one"},
        {2, "two"}
    };
 
    auto p = m.equal_range(1);
    for (auto& q = p.first; q != p.second; ++q)
        std::cout << "m[" << q->first << "] = " << q->second << '\n';
 
    if (p.second == m.find(2))
        std::cout << "end of equal_range (p.second) is one-past p.first\n";
    else
        std::cout << "unexpected; p.second expected to be one-past p.first\n";
 
    auto pp = m.equal_range(-1);
    if (pp.first == m.begin())
        std::cout << "pp.first is iterator to first not-less than -1\n";
    else
        std::cout << "unexpected pp.first\n";
 
    if (pp.second == m.begin())
        std::cout << "pp.second is iterator to first element greater-than -1\n";
    else
        std::cout << "unexpected pp.second\n";
 
    auto ppp = m.equal_range(3);
    if (ppp.first == m.end())
        std::cout << "ppp.first is iterator to first not-less than 3\n";
    else
        std::cout << "unexpected ppp.first\n";
 
    if (ppp.second == m.end())
        std::cout << "ppp.second is iterator to first element greater-than 3\n";
    else
        std::cout << "unexpected ppp.second\n";
}

```

Output:

```
m[1] = one
end of equal_range (p.second) is one-past p.first
pp.first is iterator to first not-less than -1
pp.second is iterator to first element greater-than -1
ppp.first is iterator to first not-less than 3
ppp.second is iterator to first element greater-than 3

```
