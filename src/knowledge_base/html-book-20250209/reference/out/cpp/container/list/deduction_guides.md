| ****Deduction guides****(C++17) | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<list>` |  |  |
| template< class InputIt,  class Alloc = std::allocator<                typename std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type> >  list( InputIt, InputIt, Alloc = Alloc() ) -> list<typename std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type, Alloc>; | (1) | (since C++17) |
| template< ranges::input_range R,  class Alloc = std::allocator<ranges::range_value_t<R>> >  list( std::from_range_t, R&&, Alloc = Alloc() ) -> list<ranges::range_value_t<R>, Alloc>; | (2) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

1) This deduction guide is provided for list to allow deduction from an iterator range. This overload participates in overload resolution only if `InputIt` satisfies LegacyInputIterator and `Alloc` satisfies Allocator.2) This deduction guide is provided for list to allow deduction from a std::from_range_t tag and an `input_range`.

Note: the extent to which the library determines that a type does not satisfy LegacyInputIterator is unspecified, except that as a minimum integral types do not qualify as input iterators. Likewise, the extent to which it determines that a type does not satisfy Allocator is unspecified, except that as a minimum the member type `Alloc::value_type` must exist and the expression std::declval<Alloc&>().allocate(std::size_t{}) must be well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand.

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_containers_ranges` | `202202L` | (C++23) | Ranges-aware construction and insertion; overload (2) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    // uses explicit deduction guide to deduce std::list<int>
    std::list x(v.begin(), v.end());
 
    // deduces std::list<std::vector<int>::iterator>
    // first phase of overload resolution for list-initialization selects the candidate
    // synthesized from the initializer-list constructor; second phase is not performed
    // and deduction guide has no effect
    std::list y{v.begin(), v.end()};
}

```
