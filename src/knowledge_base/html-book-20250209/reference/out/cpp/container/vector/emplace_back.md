Appends a new element to the end of the container. The element is constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct, which typically uses placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....

If after the operation the new `size()` is greater than old `capacity()` a reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the `end()` iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated. Otherwise only the `end()` iterator is invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T (the container's element type)` must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable and EmplaceConstructible. | | |

### Return value

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | (until C++17) |
| A reference to the inserted element. | (since C++17) |

### Complexity

Amortized constant.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).
If the move constructor of `T` is not noexcept and is not CopyInsertable into \*this, `vector` will use the throwing move constructor. If it throws, the guarantee is waived and the effects are unspecified.

### Notes

Since reallocation may take place, `emplace_back` requires the element type to be MoveInsertable for vectors.

### Example

The following code uses `emplace_back` to append an object of type `President` to a std::vector. It demonstrates how `emplace_back` forwards parameters to the `President` constructor and shows how using `emplace_back` avoids the extra copy or move operation required when using push_back.

Run this code

```
#include <vector>
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
struct President
{
    std::string name;
    std::string country;
    int year;
 
    President(std::string p_name, std::string p_country, int p_year)
        : name(std::move(p_name)), country(std::move(p_country)), year(p_year)
    {
        std::cout << "I am being constructed.\n";
    }
 
    President(President&& other)
        : name(std::move(other.name)), country(std::move(other.country)), year(other.year)
    {
        std::cout << "I am being moved.\n";
    }
 
    President& operator=(const President& other) = default;
};
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<President> elections;
    std::cout << "emplace_back:\n";
    auto& ref = elections.emplace_back("Nelson Mandela", "South Africa", 1994);
    assert(ref.year == 1994 && "uses a reference to the created object (C++17)");
 
    std::vector<President> reElections;
    std::cout << "\npush_back:\n";
    reElections.push_back(President("Franklin Delano Roosevelt", "the USA", 1936));
 
    std::cout << "\nContents:\n";
    for (President const& president: elections)
        std::cout << president.name << " was elected president of "
                  << president.country << " in " << president.year << ".\n";
 
    for (President const& president: reElections)
        std::cout << president.name << " was re-elected president of "
                  << president.country << " in " << president.year << ".\n";
}

```

Output:

```
emplace_back:
I am being constructed.
 
push_back:
I am being constructed.
I am being moved.
 
Contents:
Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa in 1994.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was re-elected president of the USA in 1936.

```
