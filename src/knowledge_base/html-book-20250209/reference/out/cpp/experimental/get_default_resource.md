| memory_resource\* get_default_resource() noexcept; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Gets the default memory resource pointer.

The **default memory resource pointer** is used by certain facilities when an explicit memory resource is not supplied. The initial default memory resource pointer is the return value of `new_delete_resource()`.

This function is thread-safe. Previous call to `set_default_resource` **synchronizes with** (see std::memory_order) the subsequent get_default_resource calls.

### Return value

Returns the value of the default memory resource pointer.

| set_default_resource | sets the default `memory_resource`   (function) |
| new_delete_resource | returns a static program-wide `memory_resource` that uses the global operator new and operator delete to allocate and deallocate memory   (function) |
