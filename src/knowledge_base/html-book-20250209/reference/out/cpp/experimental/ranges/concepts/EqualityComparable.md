1) The concept `EqualityComparable<T>` specifies that the comparison operators `==` and `!=` on `T` reflects equality: `==` yields true if and only if the operands are equal. `EqualityComparable<T>` is satisfied only if, given objects `a` and `b` of type `T`, bool(a == b) is true if and only if `a` and `b` are equal. Together with the requirement that a == b is equality preserving, this implies that `==` is symmetric and transitive, and further that `==` is reflexive for all objects `a` that are equal to at least one other object.2) The concept `EqualityComparableWith<T, U>` specifies that the comparison operators `==` and `!=` on (possibly mixed) `T` and `U` operands yield results consistent with equality. Comparing mixed operands yields results equivalent to comparing the operands converted to their common type. Formally, `EqualityComparableWith<T, U>` is satisfied only if, given any lvalue `t` of type const std::remove_reference_t<T> and any lvalue `u` of type const std::remove_reference_t<U>, and let `C` be ranges::common_reference_t<const std::remove_reference_t<T>&, const std::remove_reference_t<U>&>, bool(t == u) == bool(C(t) == C(u)).

### Equality preservation

An expression is **equality preserving** if it results in equal outputs given equal inputs.

- The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
- The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands modified by the expression (if any).

Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required to be **stable**: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening modification of those input objects.

### Implicit expression variations

A **requires-expression** that uses an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand also implicitly requires additional variations of that expression that accept a non-constant lvalue or (possibly constant) rvalue for the given operand unless such an expression variation is explicitly required with differing semantics. These **implicit expression variations** must meet the same semantic requirements of the declared expression. The extent to which an implementation validates the syntax of the variations is unspecified.
