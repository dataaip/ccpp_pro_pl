The concept `UniformRandomNumberGenerator<G>` specifies that `G` is the type of a uniform random number generator, that is, objects of type `G` is a function object returning unsigned integer values such that each value in the range of possible results has (ideally) equal probability of being returned.

`UniformRandomNumberGenerator<G>` is satisfied only if, given any object `g` of type `G`:

- `G::min()` and `G::max()` are prvalue constant expressions;
- `G::min() < G::max()`
- `g()` is in the range `[G::min(), G::max()]`
- `g()` has amortized constant complexity.
