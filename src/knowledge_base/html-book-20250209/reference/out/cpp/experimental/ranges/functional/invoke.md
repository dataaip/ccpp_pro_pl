| Defined in header `<experimental/ranges/functional>` |  |  |
| template< class F, class... Args >  std::result_of_t<F&&(Args&&...)> invoke( F&& f, Args&&... args ); |  | (ranges TS) |
|  |  |  |

Invoke the Callable object f with the parameters args, and return the result, as if by return INVOKE(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...);, where **INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN)** is defined as follows:

- if f is a pointer to member function of class `T`:

:   - If std::is_base_of<T, std::decay_t<decltype(t1)>>::value is true, then INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN) is equivalent to (t1.\*f)(t2, ..., tN),
    - otherwise, INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN) is equivalent to ((\*t1).\*f)(t2, ..., tN).

- otherwise, if N == 1 and f is a pointer to data member of class `T`:

:   - If std::is_base_of<T, std::decay_t<decltype(t1)>>::value is true, then INVOKE(f, t1) is equivalent to t1.\*f,
    - otherwise, then INVOKE(f, t1) is equivalent to (\*t1).\*f.

- otherwise, INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN) is equivalent to f(t1, t2, ..., tN) (that is, f is a FunctionObject).

### Parameters
