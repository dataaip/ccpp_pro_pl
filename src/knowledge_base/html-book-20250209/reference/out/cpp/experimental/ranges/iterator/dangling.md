The class template `dangling` is a simple wrapper around an object to indicate that the wrapped object may be **dangling**, that is, it refers to another object whose lifetime may have ended.

The alias template `safe_iterator_t` returns the iterator type of `R`, wrapped in `dangling` if the range was an rvalue range (as indicated by `R` not being an lvalue reference type).

They are used by range algorithms that accept rvalue ranges and return iterators into them.

### Member functions

## std::experimental::ranges::dangling::dangling

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dangling() requires DefaultConstructible<T>(); | (1) |  |
| dangling(T t); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Default constructor. Value-initializes the wrapped object.2) Initializes the wrapped object with `t`. Note that this constructor defines an implicit conversion from `T` to `dangling<T>`.

## std::experimental::ranges::dangling::get_unsafe

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T get_unsafe() const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns a copy of the wrapped object.
