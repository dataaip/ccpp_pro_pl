| namespace {  constexpr /\* unspecified \*/ prev = /\* unspecified \*/; } |  | (ranges TS)  (customization point object) |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< Iterator I >  constexpr I prev( I i ); | (1) |  |
| template< Iterator I >  constexpr I prev( I i, ranges::difference_type_t<I> n ); | (2) |  |
| template< Iterator I >  constexpr I prev( I i, ranges::difference_type_t<I> n, I bound ); | (3) |  |
|  |  |  |

Decrements the iterator i n times, or until bound is reached, whichever comes first, and returns the decremented iterator.

1) Equivalent to --i; return i;.2) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, -n); return i;.3) Equivalent to ranges::advance(i, -n, bound); return i;.

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::prev` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a function object of a literal `Semiregular` class type (denoted, for exposition purposes, as `PrevT`). All instances of `PrevT` are equal. Thus, `ranges::prev` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::prev` above, `PrevT` will satisfy ranges::Invocable<const PrevT, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of `PrevT` participates in overload resolution.

In every translation unit in which `ranges::prev` is defined, it refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

### Return value

The decremented iterator.
