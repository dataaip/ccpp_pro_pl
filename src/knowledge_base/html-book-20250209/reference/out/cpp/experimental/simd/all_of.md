1) Returns true if all values in k are true.2) Returns true if at least one value in k is true.3) Returns true if all values in k are false.4) Returns true if at least one value in k is true but not all values in k are true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| k | - | the `simd_mask` to apply the reduction to |

### Return value

The boolean result of the horizontal reduction.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <experimental/simd>
 
namespace stq = std::experimental;
 
int main()
{
    using mask = stq::fixed_size_simd_mask<int, 4>;
 
    mask mask1{false}; // = {0, 0, 0, 0}
    assert
    (
        stq::none_of(mask1) == true &&
        stq::any_of(mask1) == false &&
        stq::some_of(mask1) == false &&
        stq::all_of(mask1) == false
    );
 
    mask mask2{true}; // = {1, 1, 1, 1}
    assert
    (
        stq::none_of(mask2) == false &&
        stq::any_of(mask2) == true &&
        stq::some_of(mask2) == false &&
        stq::all_of(mask2) == true
    );
 
    mask mask3{true};
    mask3[0] = mask3[1] = false; // mask3 = {0, 0, 1, 1}
    assert
    (
        stq::none_of(mask3) == false &&
        stq::any_of(mask3) == true &&
        stq::some_of(mask3) == true &&
        stq::all_of(mask3) == false
    );
}
