Splits the input `simd` or `simd_mask` object into multiple `simd` or `simd_mask` objects.

1,2) Split the input object into potentially different types (e.g. types with different sizes) of objects. These functions do not participate in overloading resolution unless Sizes... sum up to v.size().3,4) Split the input object into an array of objects. These functions do not participate in overloading resolution unless

- The array element must be of type `simd` or `simd_mask`, for the type of v as `simd` or `simd_mask`, respectively.
- simd_size_v<typename V::value_type, Abi> is an integral multiple of V::size().
5,6) Split the input object into an array of objects. These functions shall not participate in overload resolution unless simd_size_v<T, A> is an integral multiple of `N`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | the input `simd` or `simd_mask` object |

### Return value

1,2) A tuple that contains the splitted `simd` or `simd_mask` objects.3-6) An array that contains the splitted `simd` or `simd_mask` objects.
