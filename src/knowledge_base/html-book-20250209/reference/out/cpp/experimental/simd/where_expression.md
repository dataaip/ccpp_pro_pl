| Defined in header `<experimental/simd>` |  |  |
| template< class M, class V >  class where_expression; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

The class template `where_expression` abstracts the notion of selected elements
of a given lvalue of arithmetic or data-parallel type. Selected elements are the elements of the lvalue (of type `V`) for which the corresponding element of the mask (of type `M`) is true. Operators applied to objects of type `where_expression<M, V>` are applied only to selected elements. All other elements are left unchanged.

Use the `where` function to construct `where_expression` objects.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M | - | The mask type |
| V | - | The value type M applies on |

Valid combinations of `(`M`,`V`)` are:

- `(`simd_mask<T, Abi>`,`simd<T, Abi>`)`,
- `(`simd_mask<T, Abi>`,`simd_mask<T, Abi>`)`,
- `(`bool`,`T`)`.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator=") | assigns to selected positions   (public member function) |
| operator+=operator-=operator\*=operator/=operator%=operator&=operator|=operator^=operator<<=operator>>=") | compound operators   (public member function) |
| operator++operator--") | increment and decrement operators   (public member function) |
| copy_from") | loads from address to selected positions   (public member function) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstddef>
#include <experimental/simd>
#include <iostream>
namespace stdx = std::experimental;
 
void print(auto const& a)
{
    for (std::size_t i{}; i != std::size(a); ++i)
        std::cout << a[i] << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
template<class A>
stdx::simd<int, A> my_abs(stdx::simd<int, A> x)
{
    where(x < 0, x) = -x;
    return x;
}
 
int main()
{
    const stdx::native_simd<int> a([](int i) { return i - 2; });
    print(a);
    const auto b = my_abs(a);
    print(b);
}

```

Possible output:

```
-2 -1 0 1 
2 1 0 1

```
