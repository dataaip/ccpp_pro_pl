| protected:  void init( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>\* sb ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Sets the associated stream buffer to sb and initializes the internal state.

The postconditions are as follows:

| Element | Value |
| --- | --- |
| rdbuf() | sb |
| tie() | null pointer |
| rdstate() | goodbit if sb is not a null pointer, otherwise badbit |
| exceptions() | goodbit |
| flags() | skipws | dec |
| width() | ​0​ |
| precision() | 6 |
| fill() | widen(' ') |
| getloc() | a copy of the value returned by std::locale() |

This member function is protected: it is called by the constructors of the derived stream classes std::basic_istream and std::basic_ostream once the associated stream buffer is known. Until this function is called, every member function (including the destructor) of the default-constructed std::basic_ios invokes undefined behavior. Note that `basic_ios` is a virtual base class, and therefore its constructor is not called by the constructors of those directly derived classes, which is why two-stage initialization is necessary.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sb | - | stream buffer to associate to |
