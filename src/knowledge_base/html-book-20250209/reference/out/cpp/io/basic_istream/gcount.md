| std::streamsize gcount() const; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

The following member functions of `basic_istream` change the value of subsequent `gcount()` calls:

- move constructor
- swap()
- get()
- getline()
- ignore()
- read()
- readsome()
- operator>>(basic_streambuf\*)

The following functions set `gcount()` to zero:

- constructor
- putback()
- unget()
- peek()

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the number is not representable.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    char x[20];
    std::istringstream stream("Hello World");
 
    stream.read(x, sizeof x);
    std::cout << "Characters extracted: " << stream.gcount();
}

```

Output:

```
Characters extracted: 11

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3464 | C++98 | the return value was unspecified when the result overflows | returns the maximum value |
