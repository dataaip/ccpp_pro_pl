| pos_type tellg(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns input position indicator of the current associated `streambuf` object.

Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that gcount() is not affected. After constructing and checking the sentry object, if fail() == true, returns pos_type(-1). Otherwise, returns rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::cur, std::ios_base::in).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The current position of the get pointer on success, pos_type(-1) on failure.

### Exceptions

failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit is set. If exceptions() is set for `badbit`, the exception is rethrown.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string str = "Hello, world";
    std::istringstream in(str);
    std::string word;
    in >> word;
    std::cout << "After reading the word \"" << word
              << "\" tellg() returns " << in.tellg() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
After reading the word "Hello," tellg() returns 6

```
