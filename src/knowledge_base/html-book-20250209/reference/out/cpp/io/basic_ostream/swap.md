| protected:  void swap( basic_ostream& rhs ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Calls basic_ios::swap(rhs) to swap all data members of the base class, except for rdbuf(), between \*this and rhs. This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap functions of the swappable output stream classes std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated streambuffers.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rhs | - | a basic_ostream of the same type to swap with |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s1("hello");
    std::ostringstream s2("bye");
 
    s1.swap(s2); // OK, ostringstream has a public swap()
    std::swap(s1, s2); // OK, calls s1.swap(s2)
 
//  std::cout.swap(s2); // ERROR: swap is a protected member
 
    std::cout << s1.str() << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
hello

```
