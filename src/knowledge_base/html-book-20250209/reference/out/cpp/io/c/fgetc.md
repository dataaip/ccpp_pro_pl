| Defined in header `<cstdio>` |  |  |
| int fgetc( std::FILE\* stream );  int getc( std::FILE\* stream ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Reads the next character from the given input stream.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stream | - | to read the character from |

### Return value

The obtained character on success or EOF on failure.

If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally sets the **eof** indicator (see std::feof()) on stream. If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the **error** indicator (see std::ferror()) on stream.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
 
int main()
{
    int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
    FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    if (!fp)
    {
        std::perror("File opening failed");
        return is_ok;
    }
 
    int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
    while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);
 
    if (std::ferror(fp))
        std::puts("I/O error when reading");
    else if (std::feof(fp))
    {
        std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
        is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
 
    std::fclose(fp);
    return is_ok;
}

```

Output:

```
End of file reached successfully

```
