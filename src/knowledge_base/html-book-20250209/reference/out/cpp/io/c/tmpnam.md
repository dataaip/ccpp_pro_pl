|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<cstdio>` |  |  |
| char\* tmpnam( char\* filename ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Creates a unique filename that does not name a currently existing file, and stores it in the character string pointed to by filename. The function is capable of generating up to TMP_MAX of unique filenames, but some or all of them may already be in use, and thus not suitable return values.

****std::tmpnam**** modifies static state and is not required to be thread-safe.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filename | - | pointer to the character array capable of holding at least L_tmpnam bytes, to be used as a result buffer. If a null pointer is passed, a pointer to an internal static buffer is returned |

### Return value

filename if filename was not a null pointer. Otherwise a pointer to an internal static buffer is returned. If no suitable filename can be generated, a null pointer is returned.

### Notes

Although the names generated by ****std::tmpnam**** are difficult to guess, it is possible that a file with that name is created by another process between the moment ****std::tmpnam**** returns and the moment this program attempts to use the returned name to create a file. The standard function std::tmpfile and the POSIX function `mkstemp` do not have this problem (creating a unique directory using only the standard C library still requires the use of `tmpnam`).

POSIX systems additionally define the similarly named function `tempnam`, which offers the choice of a directory (which defaults to the optionally defined macro `P_tmpdir`).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string name1 = std::tmpnam(nullptr);
    std::cout << "temporary file name: " << name1 << '\n';
 
    char name2[L_tmpnam];
    if (std::tmpnam(name2))
        std::cout << "temporary file name: " << name2 << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
temporary file name: /tmp/fileDjwifs
temporary file name: /tmp/fileEv2bfW

```
