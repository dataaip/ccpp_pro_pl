| Defined in header `<ios>` |  |  |
| std::ios_base& boolalpha( std::ios_base& str ); | (1) |  |
| std::ios_base& noboolalpha( std::ios_base& str ); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) Enables the `boolalpha` flag in the stream str as if by calling str.setf(std::ios_base::boolalpha).2) Disables the `boolalpha` flag in the stream str as if by calling str.unsetf(std::ios_base::boolalpha).

`std::boolalpha` is an I/O manipulator, so it may be called with an expression such as out << std::boolalpha for any `out` of type std::basic_ostream or with an expression such as in >> std::boolalpha for any `in` of type std::basic_istream.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | reference to I/O stream |

### Return value

str (reference to the stream after manipulation).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    // boolalpha output
    std::cout << "default true: " << true << '\n'
              << "default false: " << false << '\n'
              << std::boolalpha 
              << "boolalpha true: " << true << '\n'
              << "boolalpha false: " << false << '\n'
              << std::noboolalpha 
              << "noboolalpha true: " << true << '\n'
              << "noboolalpha false: " << false << '\n';
 
    // boolalpha parse
    bool b1, b2;
    std::istringstream is("true false");
    is >> std::boolalpha >> b1 >> b2;
 
    std::cout << '"' << is.str() << "\" parsed as: "
              << std::boolalpha << b1 << ' ' << b2 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
default true: 1
default false: 0
boolalpha true: true
boolalpha false: false
noboolalpha true: 1
noboolalpha false: 0
"true false" parsed as: true false

```
