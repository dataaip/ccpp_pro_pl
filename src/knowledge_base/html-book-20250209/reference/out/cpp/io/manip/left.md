| std::ios_base& left( std::ios_base& str ); | (1) |  |
| std::ios_base& right( std::ios_base& str ); | (2) |  |
| std::ios_base& internal( std::ios_base& str ); | (3) |  |
|  |  |  |

Modifies the positioning of the fill characters in an output stream. `left` and `right` apply to any type being output, `internal` applies to integer, floating-point, and monetary output. Has no effect on input.

1) Sets the `adjustfield` of the stream str to `left` as if by calling str.setf(std::ios_base::left, std::ios_base::adjustfield).2) Sets the `adjustfield` of the stream str to `right` as if by calling str.setf(std::ios_base::right, std::ios_base::adjustfield).3) Sets the `adjustfield` of the stream str to `internal` as if by calling str.setf(std::ios_base::internal, std::ios_base::adjustfield).

The initial default for standard streams is equivalent to `right`.

This is an I/O manipulator. It may be called with an expression such as out << std::left for any `out` of type std::basic_ostream or with an expression such as in >> std::left for any `in` of type std::basic_istream.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str | - | reference to I/O stream |

### Return value

str (reference to the stream after manipulation).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
 
    std::cout << "Default positioning:\n" << std::setfill('*')
              << std::setw(12) << -1.23  << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << std::hex << std::showbase << 42 << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << std::put_money(123, true) << "\n\n";
 
    std::cout << "Left positioning:\n" << std::left
              << std::setw(12) << -1.23  << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << 42 << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << std::put_money(123, true) << "\n\n";
 
    std::cout << "Internal positioning:\n" << std::internal
              << std::setw(12) << -1.23  << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << 42 << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << std::put_money(123, true) << "\n\n";
 
    std::cout << "Right positioning:\n" << std::right
              << std::setw(12) << -1.23  << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << 42 << '\n'
              << std::setw(12) << std::put_money(123, true) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Default positioning:
*******-1.23
********0x2a
***USD *1.23
 
Left positioning:
-1.23*******
0x2a********
USD *1.23***
 
Internal positioning:
-*******1.23
0x********2a
USD ****1.23
 
Right positioning:
*******-1.23
********0x2a
***USD *1.23

```
