| Defined in header `<iomanip>` |  |  |
| /\*unspecified\*/ setiosflags( std::ios_base::fmtflags mask ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

When used in an expression out << setiosflags(mask) or in >> setiosflags(mask), sets all format flags of the stream out or in as specified by the mask.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mask | - | bitmask of the flags to set |

### Return value

An object of unspecified type such that

- if out is an object of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, the expression out << setiosflags(mask)
  - has type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&
  - has value out
  - behaves as if it called f(out, mask)
- if in is an object of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>, the expression in >> setiosflags(mask)
  - has type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&
  - has value in
  - behaves as if it called f(in, mask)

where the function f is defined as:

```
void f(std::ios_base& str, std::ios_base::fmtflags mask)
{
    // set specified flags
    str.setf(mask);
}

```

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::resetiosflags(std::ios_base::dec) 
              << std::setiosflags(  std::ios_base::hex
                                  | std::ios_base::uppercase
                                  | std::ios_base::showbase) << 42 << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
0X2A

```

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 183 | C++98 | `setiosflags` could only be used with streams of type std::ostream or std::istream | usable with any character stream |
