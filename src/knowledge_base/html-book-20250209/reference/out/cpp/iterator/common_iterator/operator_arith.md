Increments the underlying iterator.

The behavior is undefined if the underlying std::variant member object `var` does not hold an object of type `I`, i.e. std::holds_alternative<I>(var) is equal to false.

Let `it` denote the iterator of type `I` held by `var`, that is std::get<I>(var).

1) Pre-increments by one. Equivalent to ++it; return \*this;.2) Post-increments by one:

- Equivalent to: auto tmp = \*this; ++\*this; return tmp;, if I models `forward_iterator`.
- Equivalent to: return it++;, if the variable definition auto&& ref = \*it++; is well-formed, or either

:   - std::indirectly_readable<I> or
    - std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, std::iter_reference_t<I>> or
    - std::move_constructible<std::iter_value_t<I>>

    :   is false.

- Equivalent to: postfix_proxy p(\*\*this); ++\*this; return p; otherwise, where `postfix_proxy` is an exposition only helper type (3).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

1) \*this2) A copy of \*this that was made before the change, or a result of post-increment of the underlying iterator, or a proxy keeping the value of the current element, as described above.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
 
int main()
{
    const auto il = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
 
    using CI = std::common_iterator<
                   std::counted_iterator<std::initializer_list<int>::iterator>,
                   std::default_sentinel_t
                   >;
 
    CI first{std::counted_iterator{std::begin(il), std::ssize(il) - 2}};
 
    for (; first != std::default_sentinel; ++first)
        std::cout << *first << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2259R1 | C++20 | post increment might discard its result in more situations | a proxy class is used to keep the result |
| LWG 3546 | C++20 | initialization of the proxy object was sometimes ill-formed | situation and definition adjusted |
| LWG 3574 | C++20 | `variant` was fully constexpr (P2231R1) but `common_iterator` was not | also made constexpr |
| LWG 3595 | C++20 | functions of the proxy type lacked constexpr and noexcept | added |
