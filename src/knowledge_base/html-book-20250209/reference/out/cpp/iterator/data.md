Returns a pointer to the block of memory containing the elements of the range.

1,2) Returns c.data().3) Returns array.4) Returns il.begin().

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c | - | a container or view with a data() member function |
| array | - | an array of arbitrary type |
| il | - | an std::initializer_list |

### Return value

1,2) c.data()3) array4) il.begin()

### Exceptions

1) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Notes

The overload for std::initializer_list is necessary because it does not have a member function `data`.

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_nonmember_container_access` | `201411L` | (C++17) | std::size(), `std::data()`, and std::empty() |

### Possible implementation

| First version |
| --- |
| ```text template<class C> constexpr auto data(C& c) -> decltype(c.data()) {     return c.data(); } ``` |
| Second version |
| ```text template<class C> constexpr auto data(const C& c) -> decltype(c.data()) {     return c.data(); } ``` |
| Third version |
| ```text template<class T, std::size_t N> constexpr T* data(T (&array)[N]) noexcept {     return array; } ``` |
| Fourth version |
| ```text template<class E> constexpr const E* data(std::initializer_list<E> il) noexcept {     return il.begin(); } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::string s{"Hello world!\n"};
 
    char a[20]; // storage for a C-style string
    std::strcpy(a, std::data(s));
//  [s.data(), s.data() + s.size()] is guaranteed to be an NTBS since C++11
 
    std::cout << a;
}

```

Output:

```
Hello world!

```
