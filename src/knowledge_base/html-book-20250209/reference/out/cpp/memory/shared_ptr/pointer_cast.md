|  |  |  |

Creates a new instance of std::shared_ptr whose stored pointer is obtained from r's stored pointer using a cast expression.

If r is empty, so is the new `shared_ptr` (but its stored pointer is not necessarily null). Otherwise, the new `shared_ptr` will share ownership with the initial value of r, except that it is empty if the `dynamic_cast` performed by `dynamic_pointer_cast` returns a null pointer.

Let `Y` be typename std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type, then the resulting std::shared_ptr's stored pointer will be obtained by evaluating, respectively:

1,2) static_cast<Y\*>(r.get())3,4) dynamic_cast<Y\*>(r.get()). If the result of the `dynamic_cast` is a null pointer value, the returned `shared_ptr` will be empty.5,6) const_cast<Y\*>(r.get())7,8) reinterpret_cast<Y\*>(r.get())

The behavior of these functions is undefined unless the corresponding cast from `U*` to `T*` is well formed:

1,2) The behavior is undefined unless static_cast<T\*>((U\*)nullptr) is well formed.3,4) The behavior is undefined unless dynamic_cast<T\*>((U\*)nullptr) is well formed.5,6) The behavior is undefined unless const_cast<T\*>((U\*)nullptr) is well formed.7,8) The behavior is undefined unless reinterpret_cast<T\*>((U\*)nullptr) is well formed.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| After calling the rvalue overloads (2,4,6,8), r is empty and r.get() == nullptr, except that r is not modified for `dynamic_pointer_cast` (4) if the dynamic_cast fails. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r | - | the pointer to convert |

### Notes

The expressions std::shared_ptr<T>(static_cast<T\*>(r.get())), std::shared_ptr<T>(dynamic_cast<T\*>(r.get())) and std::shared_ptr<T>(const_cast<T\*>(r.get())) might seem to have the same effect, but they all will likely result in undefined behavior, attempting to delete the same object twice!

### Possible implementation

| static_pointer_cast |
| --- |
| ```text template<class T, class U> std::shared_ptr<T> static_pointer_cast(const std::shared_ptr<U>& r) noexcept {     auto p = static_cast<typename std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type*>(r.get());     return std::shared_ptr<T>{r, p}; } ``` |
| dynamic_pointer_cast |
| ```text template<class T, class U> std::shared_ptr<T> dynamic_pointer_cast(const std::shared_ptr<U>& r) noexcept {     if (auto p = dynamic_cast<typename std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type*>(r.get()))         return std::shared_ptr<T>{r, p};     else         return std::shared_ptr<T>{}; } ``` |
| const_pointer_cast |
| ```text template<class T, class U> std::shared_ptr<T> const_pointer_cast(const std::shared_ptr<U>& r) noexcept {     auto p = const_cast<typename std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type*>(r.get());     return std::shared_ptr<T>{r, p}; } ``` |
| reinterpret_pointer_cast |
| ```text template<class T, class U> std::shared_ptr<T> reinterpret_pointer_cast(const std::shared_ptr<U>& r) noexcept {     auto p = reinterpret_cast<typename std::shared_ptr<T>::element_type*>(r.get());     return std::shared_ptr<T>{r, p}; } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
class Base
{
public:
    int a;
    virtual void f() const { std::cout << "I am base!\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() {}
};
 
class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    void f() const override { std::cout << "I am derived!\n"; }
    ~Derived() {}
};
 
int main()
{
    auto basePtr = std::make_shared<Base>();
    std::cout << "Base pointer says: ";
    basePtr->f();
 
    auto derivedPtr = std::make_shared<Derived>();
    std::cout << "Derived pointer says: ";
    derivedPtr->f();
 
    // static_pointer_cast to go up class hierarchy
    basePtr = std::static_pointer_cast<Base>(derivedPtr);
    std::cout << "Base pointer to derived says: ";
    basePtr->f();
 
    // dynamic_pointer_cast to go down/across class hierarchy
    auto downcastedPtr = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<Derived>(basePtr);
    if (downcastedPtr)
    {
        std::cout << "Downcasted pointer says: ";
        downcastedPtr->f();
    }
 
    // All pointers to derived share ownership
    std::cout << "Pointers to underlying derived: "
              << derivedPtr.use_count()
              << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
Base pointer says: I am base!
Derived pointer says: I am derived!
Base pointer to derived says: I am derived!
Downcasted pointer says: I am derived!
Pointers to underlying derived: 3

```
