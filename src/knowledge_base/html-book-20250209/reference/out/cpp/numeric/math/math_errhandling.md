| Defined in header `<cmath>` |  |  |
| #define MATH_ERRNO        1 |  | (since C++11) |
| #define MATH_ERREXCEPT    2 |  | (since C++11) |
| #define math_errhandling  /\*implementation defined\*/ |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

The macro constant `math_errhandling` expands to an expression of type int that is either equal to `MATH_ERRNO`, or equal to `MATH_ERREXCEPT`, or equal to their bitwise OR (MATH_ERRNO | MATH_ERREXCEPT).

The value of `math_errhandling` indicates the type of error handling that is performed by the floating-point operators and functions:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Constant | Explanation |
| `MATH_ERREXCEPT` | Indicates that floating-point exceptions are used: at least FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW are defined in <cfenv>. |
| `MATH_ERRNO` | Indicates that floating-point operations use the variable errno to report errors. |

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT is required to be non-zero.

The following floating-point error conditions are recognized:

| Condition | Explanation | errno | Floating-point exception | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain error | The argument is outside the range in which the operation is mathematically defined (the description of each function lists the required domain errors) | EDOM | FE_INVALID | std::acos(2) |
| Pole error | The mathematical result of the function is exactly infinite or undefined | ERANGE | FE_DIVBYZERO | std::log(0.0), 1.0 / 0.0 |
| Range error due to overflow | The mathematical result is finite, but becomes infinite after rounding, or becomes the largest representable finite value after rounding down | ERANGE | FE_OVERFLOW | std::pow(DBL_MAX, 2) |
| Range error due to underflow | The result is non-zero, but becomes zero after rounding, or becomes subnormal with a loss of precision | ERANGE or unchanged (implementation-defined) | FE_UNDERFLOW or nothing (implementation-defined) | DBL_TRUE_MIN / 2 |
| Inexact result | The result has to be rounded to fit in the destination type | Unchanged | FE_INEXACT or nothing (unspecified) | std::sqrt(2), 1.0 / 10.0 |

### Notes

Whether FE_INEXACT is raised by the mathematical library functions is unspecified in general, but may be explicitly specified in the description of the function (e.g. std::rint vs std::nearbyint).

Before C++11, floating-point exceptions were not specified, EDOM was required for any domain error, ERANGE was required for overflows and implementation-defined for underflows.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "MATH_ERRNO is "
              << (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO ? "set" : "not set") << '\n'
              << "MATH_ERREXCEPT is "
              << (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT ? "set" : "not set") << '\n';
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    errno = 0;
    std::cout <<  "log(0) = " << std::log(0) << '\n';
    if (errno == ERANGE)
        std::cout << "errno = ERANGE (" << std::strerror(errno) << ")\n";
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
        std::cout << "FE_DIVBYZERO (pole error) reported\n";
}

```

Possible output:

```
MATH_ERRNO is set
MATH_ERREXCEPT is set
log(0) = -inf
errno = ERANGE (Numerical result out of range)
FE_DIVBYZERO (pole error) reported

```
