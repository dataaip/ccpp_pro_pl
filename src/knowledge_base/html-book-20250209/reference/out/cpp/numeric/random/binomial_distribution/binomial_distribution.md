Constructs a new distribution object.

2) Uses t and p as the distribution parameters.3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t | - | the **t** distribution parameter (number of trials) |
| p | - | the **p** distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true) |
| params | - | the distribution parameter set |

### Notes

Requires that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ t.

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0935R0 | C++11 | default constructor was explicit | made implicit |
