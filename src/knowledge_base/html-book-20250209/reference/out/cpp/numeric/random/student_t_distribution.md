Produces random floating-point values x, distributed according to probability density function:

:   \(p(x|n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\pi} } \cdot \frac{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2})} \cdot (1+\frac{x^2}{n})^{-\frac{n+1}{2} } \)p(x|n) =

where n is known as the number of **degrees of freedom**. This distribution is used when estimating the **mean** of an unknown normally distributed value given n + 1 independent measurements, each with additive errors of unknown standard deviation, as in physical measurements. Or, alternatively, when estimating the unknown mean of a normal distribution with unknown standard deviation, given n + 1 samples.

`std::student_t_distribution` satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RealType | - | The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double. |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `result_type` (C++11) | RealType |
| `param_type` (C++11) | the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution. |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(C++11) | constructs new distribution   (public member function) |
| reset(C++11) | resets the internal state of the distribution   (public member function) |
| Generation | |
| operator()")(C++11) | generates the next random number in the distribution   (public member function) |
| Characteristics | |
| n | returns the **n** distribution parameter (degrees of freedom)   (public member function) |
| param(C++11) | gets or sets the distribution parameter object   (public member function) |
| min(C++11) | returns the minimum potentially generated value   (public member function) |
| max(C++11) | returns the maximum potentially generated value   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator==operator!=(C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20) | compares two distribution objects   (function) |
| operator<<operator>>(C++11) | performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution   (function template) |

    const int norm = 10'000;
    const float cutoff = 0.000'3f;
 
    std::map<int, int> hist{};
    for (int n = 0; n != norm; ++n)
        ++hist[std::round(d(gen))];
 
    std::vector<float> bars;
