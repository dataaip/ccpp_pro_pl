1-3) Computes the complete elliptic integral of the second kind of k. The library provides overloads of `std::comp_ellint_2` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter k.(since C++23)A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| k | - | elliptic modulus or eccentricity (a floating-point or integer value) |

### Return value

If no errors occur, value of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind of k, that is std::ellint_2(k, π/2), is returned.

### Error handling

Errors may be reported as specified in math_errhandling.

- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned and domain error is not reported.
- If |k|>1, a domain error may occur.

### Notes

Implementations that do not support C++17, but support ISO 29124:2010, provide this function if `__STDCPP_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__` is defined by the implementation to a value at least 201003L and if the user defines `__STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__` before including any standard library headers.

Implementations that do not support ISO 29124:2010 but support TR 19768:2007 (TR1), provide this function in the header `tr1/cmath` and namespace `std::tr1`.

An implementation of this function is also available in boost.math.

The perimeter of an ellipse with eccentricity k and semimajor axis a equals 4aE(k), where E is `std::comp_ellint_2`. When eccentricity equals 0, the ellipse degenerates to a circle with radius a and the perimeter equals 2πa, so E(0) = π/2. When eccentricity equals 1, the ellipse degenerates to a line of length 2a, whose perimeter is 4a, so E(1) = 1.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::comp_ellint_2(num) has the same effect as std::comp_ellint_2(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <numbers>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr double hpi = std::numbers::pi / 2.0;
 
    std::cout << "E(0) = " << std::comp_ellint_2(0) << '\n'
              << "π/2 = " << hpi << '\n'
              << "E(1) = " << std::comp_ellint_2(1) << '\n'
              << "E(1, π/2) = " << std::ellint_2(1, hpi) << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
E(0) = 1.5708
π/2 = 1.5708
E(1) = 1
E(1, π/2) = 1

```
