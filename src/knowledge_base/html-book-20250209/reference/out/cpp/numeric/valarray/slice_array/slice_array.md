| public:  slice_array( const slice_array& other ); | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

1) The default constructor is declared private and not defined(until C++11)explicitly defined as deleted(since C++11): `slice_array` is not DefaultConstructible.2) Constructs a `slice_array` from another `slice_array` other.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | `slice_array` to initialize with |
