| template< class A >  struct hash<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, A>>; | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< class A >  struct hash<std::basic_string<char16_t, std::char_traits<char16_t>, A>>; | (2) | (since C++11) |
| template< class A >  struct hash<std::basic_string<char32_t, std::char_traits<char32_t>, A>>; | (3) | (since C++11) |

|  |  |  |

The template specializations of std::hash for the various string classes allow users to obtain hashes of strings.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| These hashes equal the hashes of corresponding std::basic_string_view classes: If `S` is one of these string types, `SV` is the corresponding string view type, and `s` is an object of type `S`, then std::hash<S>()(s) == std::hash<SV>()(SV(s)). | (since C++17) |

### Example

The following code shows one possible output of a hash function used on a string:

Run this code

```
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory_resource>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
using namespace std::literals;
 
int main()
{
    auto sv = "Stand back! I've got jimmies!"sv;
    std::string s(sv);
    std::pmr::string pmrs(sv); // use default allocator
 
    std::cout << std::hash<std::string_view>{}(sv) << '\n';
    std::cout << std::hash<std::string>{}(s) << '\n';
    std::cout << std::hash<std::pmr::string>{}(pmrs) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
3544599705012401047
3544599705012401047
3544599705012401047

```

### Defect reports
