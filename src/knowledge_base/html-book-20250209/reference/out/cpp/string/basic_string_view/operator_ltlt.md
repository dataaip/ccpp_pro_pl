| Defined in header `<string_view>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT, class Traits >  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&      operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> v ); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Behaves as a FormattedOutputFunction. After constructing and checking the sentry object, determines the output format padding.

Then stores each character from the resulting sequence seq (the contents of v with padding) to the output stream os as if by calling os.rdbuf()->sputn(seq, n), where n is std::max(os.width(), str.size()).

Finally, calls os.width(0) to cancel the effects of std::setw, if any.

### Exceptions

May throw std::ios_base::failure if an exception is thrown during output.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os | - | a character output stream |
| v | - | the view to be inserted |

### Return value

os

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr std::string_view s{"abc"};
    constexpr int width{5};
 
    // fill/left/right properties are kept until changed
    std::cout << std::setfill('-');
    std::cout << std::left;
 
    std::cout << '[' << std::setw(width) << s << "]\n";
    std::cout << '[' << std::setw(width) << s << "]\n";
 
    std::cout << std::right;
    std::cout << '[' << std::setw(width) << s << "]\n";
 
    // width is reset after each call
    std::cout << '[' << s << "]\n";
}

```

Output:

```
[abc--]
[abc--]
[--abc]
[abc]

```
