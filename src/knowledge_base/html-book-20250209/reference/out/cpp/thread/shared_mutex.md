| class shared_mutex; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

The `shared_mutex` class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. In contrast to other mutex types which facilitate exclusive access, a shared_mutex has two levels of access:

- **shared** - several threads can share ownership of the same mutex.

- **exclusive** - only one thread can own the mutex.

If one thread has acquired the **exclusive** lock (through lock, try_lock), no other threads can acquire the lock (including the **shared**).

If one thread has acquired the **shared** lock (through lock_shared, try_lock_shared), no other thread can acquire the **exclusive** lock, but can acquire the **shared** lock.

Only when the **exclusive** lock has not been acquired by any thread, the **shared** lock can be acquired by multiple threads.

Within one thread, only one lock (**shared** or **exclusive**) can be acquired at the same time.

Shared mutexes are especially useful when shared data can be safely read by any number of threads simultaneously, but a thread may only write the same data when no other thread is reading or writing at the same time.

The `shared_mutex` class satisfies all requirements of SharedMutex and StandardLayoutType.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `native_handle_type` (optional\*) | implementation-defined |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs the mutex   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destroys the mutex   (public member function) |
| operator=[deleted] | not copy-assignable   (public member function) |
| Exclusive locking | |
| lock | locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available   (public member function) |
| try_lock | tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available   (public member function) |
| unlock | unlocks the mutex   (public member function) |
| Shared locking | |
| lock_shared | locks the mutex for shared ownership, blocks if the mutex is not available   (public member function) |
| try_lock_shared | tries to lock the mutex for shared ownership, returns if the mutex is not available   (public member function) |
| unlock_shared | unlocks the mutex (shared ownership)   (public member function) |
| Native handle | |
| native_handle | returns the underlying implementation-defined native handle object   (public member function) |

### Example

The output below was generated on a single-core machine. When `thread1` starts, it enters the loop for the first time and calls `increment()` followed by `get()`. However, before it can print the returned value to std::cout, the scheduler puts `thread1` to sleep and wakes up `thread2`, which obviously has time enough to run all three loop iterations at once. Back to `thread1`, still in the first loop iteration, it finally prints its local copy of the counter's value, which is 1, to `std::cout` and then runs the remaining two loop iterations. On a multi-core machine, none of the threads is put to sleep and the output is more likely to be in ascending order.

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <shared_mutex>
#include <syncstream>
#include <thread>
 
class ThreadSafeCounter
{
public:
    ThreadSafeCounter() = default;
 
    // Multiple threads/readers can read the counter's value at the same time.
    unsigned int get() const
    {
        std::shared_lock lock(mutex_);
        return value_;
    }
 
    // Only one thread/writer can increment/write the counter's value.
    void increment()
    {
        std::unique_lock lock(mutex_);
        ++value_;
    }
 
    // Only one thread/writer can reset/write the counter's value.
    void reset()
    {
        std::unique_lock lock(mutex_);
        value_ = 0;
    }
 
private:
    mutable std::shared_mutex mutex_;
    unsigned int value_{};
};
 
int main()
{
    ThreadSafeCounter counter;
 
    auto increment_and_print = [&counter]()
    {
        for (int i{}; i != 3; ++i)
        {
            counter.increment();
            std::osyncstream(std::cout)
                << std::this_thread::get_id() << ' ' << counter.get() << '\n';
        }
    };
 
    std::thread thread1(increment_and_print);
    std::thread thread2(increment_and_print);
 
    thread1.join();
    thread2.join();
}

```

Possible output:

```
123084176803584 2
123084176803584 3
123084176803584 4
123084185655040 1
123084185655040 5
123084185655040 6
