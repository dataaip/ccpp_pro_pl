Constructs a `unique_lock`, optionally locking the supplied mutex.

1) Constructs a `unique_lock` with no associated mutex.2) Move constructor. Initializes the `unique_lock` with the contents of other. Leaves other with no associated mutex.3-8) Constructs a `unique_lock` with m as the associated mutex. Additionally:3) Locks the associated mutex by calling m.lock().4) Does not lock the associated mutex.5) Tries to lock the associated mutex without blocking by calling m.try_lock(). The behavior is undefined if `Mutex` does not satisfy Lockable.6) Assumes the calling thread already holds a non-shared lock (i.e., a lock acquired by `lock`, `try_lock`, `try_lock_for`, or `try_lock_until`) on m. The behavior is undefined if not so.7) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_for(timeout_duration). Blocks until specified timeout_duration has elapsed or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May block for longer than timeout_duration. The behavior is undefined if `Mutex` does not satisfy TimedLockable.8) Tries to lock the associated mutex by calling m.try_lock_until(timeout_time). Blocks until specified timeout_time has been reached or the lock is acquired, whichever comes first. May block for longer than until timeout_time has been reached. The behavior is undefined if `Mutex` does not satisfy TimedLockable.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another `unique_lock` to initialize the state with |
| m | - | mutex to associate with the lock and optionally acquire ownership of |
| t | - | tag parameter used to select constructors with different locking strategies |
| timeout_duration | - | maximum duration to block for |
| timeout_time | - | maximum time point to block until |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
#include <utility>
#include <vector>
 
std::mutex m_a, m_b, m_c;
int a, b, c = 1;
 
void update()
{
    {   // Note: std::lock_guard or atomic<int> can be used instead
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m_a);
        ++a;
    }
 
    {   // Note: see std::lock and std::scoped_lock for details and alternatives
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_b(m_b, std::defer_lock);
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk_c(m_c, std::defer_lock);
        std::lock(lk_b, lk_c);
        b = std::exchange(c, b + c);
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 12; ++i)
        threads.emplace_back(update);
 
    for (auto& i : threads)
        i.join();
 
    std::cout << a << "'th and " << a + 1 << "'th Fibonacci numbers: "
              << b << " and " << c << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
12'th and 13'th Fibonacci numbers: 144 and 233

```
