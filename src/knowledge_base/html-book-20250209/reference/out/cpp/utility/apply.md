|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<tuple>` |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class F, class Tuple >  constexpr decltype(auto) apply( F&& f, Tuple&& t ); |  | (since C++17)  (until C++23) |
| template< class F, tuple-like Tuple >  constexpr decltype(auto) apply( F&& f, Tuple&& t ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

Invoke the Callable object f with the elements of t as arguments.

Given the exposition-only function `apply-impl` defined as follows:

template<class F,class Tuple, std::size_t... I>  
constexpr decltype(auto)  
`apply-impl`(F&& f, Tuple&& t, std::index_sequence<I...>) // exposition only  
`{`  
return**INVOKE**(std::forward<F>(f), std::get<I>(std::forward<Tuple>(t))...);  
`}`

The effect is equivalent to:

return`apply-impl`(std::forward<F>(f), std::forward<Tuple>(t),  
std::make_index_sequence<  
std::tuple_size_v<std::decay_t<Tuple>>>{});
.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | - | Callable object to be invoked |
| t | - | tuple whose elements to be used as arguments to f |

### Return value

The value returned by f.

### Exceptions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | (until C++23) |
| noexcept specification:noexcept(  noexcept(std::invoke(std::forward<F>(f),                           std::get<Is>(std::forward<Tuple>(t))...)) ) where `Is...` denotes the pack:   - 0, 1, ..., std::tuple_size_v<std::remove_reference_t<Tuple>> - 1. | (since C++23) |

### Notes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `Tuple` need not be std::tuple, and instead may be anything that supports std::get and std::tuple_size; in particular, std::array and std::pair may be used. | (until C++23) |
| `Tuple` is constrained to be tuple-like, i.e. each type therein is required to be a specialization of std::tuple or another type (such as std::array and std::pair) that models **tuple-like**. | (since C++23) |

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_apply` | `201603L` | (C++17) | `std::apply` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
 
int add(int first, int second) { return first + second; }
 
template<typename T>
T add_generic(T first, T second) { return first + second; }
 
auto add_lambda = [](auto first, auto second) { return first + second; };
 
template<typename... Ts>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, std::tuple<Ts...> const& theTuple)
{
    std::apply
    (
        &os
        {
            os << '[';
            std::size_t n{0};
            ((os << tupleArgs << (++n != sizeof...(Ts) ? ", " : "")), ...);
            os << ']';
        }, theTuple
    );
    return os;
}
 
int main()
{
    // OK
    std::cout << std::apply(add, std::pair(1, 2)) << '\n';
 
    // Error: can't deduce the function type
    // std::cout << std::apply(add_generic, std::make_pair(2.0f, 3.0f)) << '\n'; 
 
    // OK
    std::cout << std::apply(add_lambda, std::pair(2.0f, 3.0f)) << '\n'; 
 
    // advanced example
    std::tuple myTuple{25, "Hello", 9.31f, 'c'};
    std::cout << myTuple << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
3
5
[25, Hello, 9.31, c]

```
