Constructs an empty `basic_stacktrace`, or copy/move from other.

1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty `basic_stacktrace` with a default-constructed allocator.2) Constructs an empty `basic_stacktrace` using alloc as the allocator.3) Copy constructor. Constructs a `basic_stacktrace` with the copy of the contents of other, the allocator is obtained as if by calling std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction(other.get_allocator()).4) Move constructor. Constructs a `basic_stacktrace` with the contents of other using move semantics. Allocator is move-constructed from that of other. After construction, other is left in a valid but unspecified state.5) Same as the copy constructor, except that alloc is used as the allocator.6) Behaves same as the move constructor if alloc == other.get_allocator(). Otherwise, allocates memory with alloc and performs element-wise move. alloc is used as the allocator.

(3,5,6) may throw an exception or construct an empty `basic_stacktrace` on allocation failure.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alloc | - | allocator to use for all memory allocations of the constructed `basic_stacktrace` |
| other | - | another `basic_stacktrace` to copy/move from |

### Exceptions

1)noexcept specification:noexcept(std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v<allocator_type>)3,5,6) May propagate the exception thrown on allocation failure.

### Complexity

1,2) Constant.3) Linear in size of other.4) Constant.5) Linear in size of other.6) Linear in size of other if alloc != other.get_allocator(), otherwise constant.

### Notes

After container move construction (overload (4)), references, pointers, and iterators (other than the end iterator) to `other` remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in \*this. The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in [[container.reqmts]/67](https://eel.is/c++draft/container.reqmts#67), and a more direct guarantee is under consideration via LWG issue 2321.
