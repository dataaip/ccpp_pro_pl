Let s[i] (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) denote the (`i+1`)-th stacktrace entry in the stacktrace of the current evaluation in the current thread of execution, where `n` is the count of the stacktrace entries in the stackentry.

1) Attempts to create a `basic_stacktrace` consisting of s[0], s[1], ..., s[n - 1].2) Attempts to create a `basic_stacktrace` consisting of s[m], s[m + 1], ..., s[n - 1], where `m` is `min(skip, n)`.3) Attempts to create a `basic_stacktrace` consisting of s[m], s[m + 1], ..., s[o - 1], where `m` is `min(skip, n)` and `o` is `min(skip + max_depth, n)`. The behavior is undefined if the skip + max_depth < skip (i.e. the mathematical result of skip + max_depth overflows).

In all cases, `alloc` is stored into the created `basic_stacktrace` and used to allocate the storage for stacktrace entries.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alloc | - | allocator to use for all memory allocations of the constructed `basic_stacktrace` |
| skip | - | the number of stacktrace entries to skip |
| max_depth | - | the maximum depth of the stacktrace entries |

### Return value

If the allocation succeeds, the `basic_stacktrace` described above.

Otherwise, an empty `basic_stacktrace`.
