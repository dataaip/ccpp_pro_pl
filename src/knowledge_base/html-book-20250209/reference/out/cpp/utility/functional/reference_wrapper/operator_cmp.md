Performs comparison operations on `reference_wrapper` objects.

1,2) Compares two `reference_wrapper` objects. The objects compare equal if and only if lhs.get() and rhs.get() are equal.1) This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression lhs.get() == rhs.get() is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.2) This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_const_v<T> is false.
- The expression lhs.get() == rhs.get() is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.
3) Compares `reference_wrapper` object with a reference. The parameters compare equal if and only if lhs.get() is equal to ref. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression lhs.get() == ref is well-formed and its result is convertible to bool.4,5) Compares two `reference_wrapper` objects using **synth-three-way**.4) This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression **synth-three-way**(lhs.get(), rhs.get()) is well-formed.5) This overload participates in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

- std::is_const_v<T> is false.
- The expression **synth-three-way**(lhs.get(), rhs.get()) is well-formed.
6) Compares `reference_wrapper` object with a reference using **synth-three-way**. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the expression **synth-three-way**(lhs.get(), ref) is well-formed.

The `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `!=` operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | `reference_wrapper` object to compare |
| ref | - | reference to compare to the `reference_wrapper` object |

### Return value

1,2) lhs.get() == rhs.get().3) lhs.get() == ref.4,5) **synth-three-way**(lhs.get(), rhs.get()).6) **synth-three-way**(lhs.get(), ref).

### Exceptions

Throws when and what the comparison throws.

### Notes

The return types of operator<=> are deduced from return statements to avoid hard error when instantiating a std::reference_wrapper<T> with **synth-three-way-result**<T> being ill-formed.
