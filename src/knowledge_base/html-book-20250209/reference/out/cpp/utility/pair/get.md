Extracts an element from the pair using tuple-like interface.

1-4) The index-based overloads fail to compile if the index `I` is neither ​0​ nor 1.5-12) The type-based overloads fail to compile if the types `T` and `U` are the same.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p | - | pair whose contents to extract |

### Return value

1-4) Returns a reference to p.first if I == 0 and a reference to p.second if I == 1.5-8) Returns a reference to p.first.9-12) Returns a reference to p.second.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
    auto p = std::make_pair(1, 3.14);
    std::cout << '(' << std::get<0>(p) << ", " << std::get<1>(p) << ")\n";
    std::cout << '(' << std::get<int>(p) << ", " << std::get<double>(p) << ")\n";
}

```

Output:

```
(1, 3.14)
(1, 3.14)

```

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2485 | C++11 (by index) C++14 (by type) | there are no overloads for const pair&& | the overloads are added |
