| Defined in header `<variant>` |  |  |
| template< class... Types >  class variant; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

The class template `std::variant` represents a type-safe union. An instance of `std::variant` at any given time either holds a value of one of its alternative types, or in the case of error - no value (this state is hard to achieve, see valueless_by_exception).

As with unions, if a variant holds a value of some object type `T`, the `T` object is nested within the `variant` object itself. Variant is not allowed to allocate additional (dynamic) memory.

A variant is not permitted to hold references, arrays, or the type void.

A variant is permitted to hold the same type more than once, and to hold differently cv-qualified versions of the same type.

Consistent with the behavior of unions during aggregate initialization, a default-constructed variant holds a value of its first alternative, unless that alternative is not default-constructible (in which case the variant is not default-constructible either). The helper class std::monostate can be used to make such variants default-constructible.

A program that instantiates the definition of `std::variant` with no template arguments is ill-formed. std::variant<std::monostate> can be used instead.

If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of `std::variant`, the program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Types | - | the types that may be stored in this variant. All types must meet the Destructible requirements (in particular, array types and non-object types are not allowed). |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs the `variant` object   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destroys the `variant`, along with its contained value   (public member function) |
| operator= | assigns a `variant`   (public member function) |
| Observers | |
| index | returns the zero-based index of the alternative held by the `variant`   (public member function) |
| valueless_by_exception | checks if the `variant` is in the invalid state   (public member function) |
| Modifiers | |
| emplace | constructs a value in the `variant`, in place   (public member function) |
| swap | swaps with another `variant`   (public member function) |
| Visitation | |
| visit(C++26) | calls the provided functor with the argument held by the `variant`   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| visit(C++17) | calls the provided functor with the arguments held by one or more `variant`s   (function template) |
| holds_alternative(C++17) | checks if a `variant` currently holds a given type   (function template) |
| get(std::variant)(C++17) | reads the value of the variant given the index or the type (if the type is unique), throws on error   (function template) |
| get_if(C++17) | obtains a pointer to the value of a pointed-to `variant` given the index or the type (if unique), returns null on error   (function template) |
| operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=operator<=>(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++17)(C++20) | compares `variant` objects as their contained values   (function template) |
| std::swap(std::variant)(C++17) | specializes the std::swap algorithm   (function template) |

### Helper classes

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| monostate(C++17) | placeholder type for use as the first alternative in a `variant` of non-default-constructible types   (class) |
| bad_variant_access(C++17) | exception thrown on invalid accesses to the value of a `variant`   (class) |
| variant_sizevariant_size_v(C++17) | obtains the size of the `variant`'s list of alternatives at compile time (class template) (variable template) |
| variant_alternativevariant_alternative_t(C++17) | obtains the type of the alternative specified by its index, at compile time (class template) (alias template) |
| std::hash<std::variant>(C++17) | hash support for ****std::variant****   (class template specialization) |

### Helper objects

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| variant_npos(C++17) | index of the `variant` in the invalid state   (constant) |

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_variant` | `201606L` | (C++17) | `std::variant`: a type-safe union |
| `202102L` | (C++23) (DR17) | std::visit for classes derived from `std::variant` |
| `202106L` | (C++23) (DR20) | Fully `constexpr` `std::variant` |
| `202306L` | (C++26) | Member `visit` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <variant>
 
int main()
{
    std::variant<int, float> v, w;
    v = 42; // v contains int
    int i = std::get<int>(v);
    assert(42 == i); // succeeds
    w = std::get<int>(v);
    w = std::get<0>(v); // same effect as the previous line
    w = v; // same effect as the previous line
 
//  std::get<double>(v); // error: no double in [int, float]
//  std::get<3>(v);      // error: valid index values are 0 and 1
 
    try
    {
        std::get<float>(w); // w contains int, not float: will throw
    }
    catch (const std::bad_variant_access& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    using namespace std::literals;
 
    std::variant<std::string> x("abc");
    // converting constructors work when unambiguous
    x = "def"; // converting assignment also works when unambiguous
 
    std::variant<std::string, void const*> y("abc");
    // casts to void const* when passed a char const*
    assert(std::holds_alternative<void const*>(y)); // succeeds
    y = "xyz"s;
    assert(std::holds_alternative<std::string>(y)); // succeeds
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::get: wrong index for variant

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2901 | C++17 | specialization of std::uses_allocator provided, but `std::variant` cannot properly support allocators | specialization removed |
| LWG 3990 | C++17 | a program could declare an explicit or partial specialization of `std::variant` | the program is ill-formed in this case (no diagnostic required) |
